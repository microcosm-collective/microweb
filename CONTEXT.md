# Microweb Domain Glossary

This project is the server-rendered Django web client for the Microcosm forum platform. It has no database — all state lives behind the Microcosm REST API. The migration is from Python 2.7 / Django 1.5 (`main` branch) to Python 3.14 / Django 6.0 (`py3-dj6` branch), modernisation only — no new features.

## Terms

**Site** — A single forum community (the tenant). Each Site has its own subdomain or custom domain (CNAME), branding (logo, colours, theme), and an owning Profile. One customer = one Site.

**Microcosm** — A category within a Site. Contains Items (Conversations, Events, Polls). Microcosms can nest via `parentId`, but the browser URL structure is flat (`/microcosms/{id}/`) — hierarchy is shown via breadcrumbs only.

**Conversation** — A discussion thread within a Microcosm. A commentable item.

**Event** — A real-world meetup or calendar occurrence within a Microcosm. Like a Conversation but with a when (date/time), where (geocoded location), and an attendee list with RSVP. A commentable item.

**Poll** — A votable item type. Defined in the API and declared in microweb's resource type lists, but microweb has no views for it currently.

**Comment** — A user-posted message attached to a commentable item (Conversation, Event, Poll, or Huddle). Supports attachments, edit history (revisions), and an `inContext` URL that resolves to the correct page offset within the parent item.

**Huddle** — A private message thread. Multi-party (has a participant list). Commentable like a Conversation but visible only to participants.

**User** — A platform-wide identity. One person has one User across all Sites.

**Profile** — A User's presence on a specific Site. Carries site-local attributes (avatar, bio, permissions). A User has one Profile per Site they participate in.

**Role** — A named permission group scoped to a single Microcosm. Profiles are assigned to Roles to grant or restrict access.

**RoleCriteria** — Rules that auto-assign Profiles to a Role based on matching conditions.

**Watcher** — A Profile's subscription to a specific item (Conversation, Event, or Microcosm). Controls whether the item appears in the "following" feed (`/updates`) and whether email/SMS notifications are sent for new activity.

**Update** — A feed entry generated when a watched item has new activity. The Updates list is the output of the Watcher mechanism — "here's what happened on things you follow."

**Ignored** — A per-Profile mute. Ignoring a Profile hides their posts within existing Conversations. Ignoring a Conversation (or other item) hides it from the feed entirely.

**Trending** — The 25 "hottest" items on the Site, ranked by an activity score using Newton's Law of Cooling: recent comment count as temperature, decayed exponentially by time since last comment, penalised by overall item age.

**Today** — A "what's new since your last visit" view. Displays recently active items (Conversations, Events, Profiles, Huddles) via the Search API with a recency filter.

**Redirect** — Legacy URL resolution for forums imported onto custom domains. When a CNAME request doesn't match any native route, the API is consulted for a mapping from the old platform's URL to the corresponding Microcosm resource. Issues a 301 if found.

**Legal** — Site-configurable policy documents (terms of service, privacy policy, acceptable use, etc.).

**Attachment** — A file uploaded to a Comment or other resource.
